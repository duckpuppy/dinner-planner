## Beads Workflow

You MUST abide by the following workflow:

<beads-workflow>
<requirement>You MUST follow this worktree-per-task workflow for ALL implementation work.</requirement>

<on-task-start>
1. **Parse task parameters from orchestrator:**
   - BEAD_ID: Your task ID (e.g., BD-001 for standalone, BD-001.2 for epic child)
   - EPIC_ID: (epic children only) The parent epic ID (e.g., BD-001)

2. **Create worktree (via API with git fallback):**
   ```bash
   REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   WORKTREE_PATH="$REPO_ROOT/.worktrees/bd-{BEAD_ID}"

   # Try API first (requires beads-kanban-ui running)
   API_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3008/api/git/worktree \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"repo_path": "'$REPO_ROOT'", "bead_id": "{BEAD_ID}"}' 2>/dev/null)

   # Fallback to git if API unavailable
   if [[ -z "$API_RESPONSE" ]] || echo "$API_RESPONSE" | grep -q "error"; then
     mkdir -p "$REPO_ROOT/.worktrees"
     if [[ ! -d "$WORKTREE_PATH" ]]; then
       git worktree add "$WORKTREE_PATH" -b bd-{BEAD_ID}
     fi
   fi

   cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
   ```

3. **Mark in progress:**
   ```bash
   bd update {BEAD_ID} --status in_progress
   ```

4. **Read bead comments for investigation context:**
   ```bash
   bd show {BEAD_ID}
   bd comments {BEAD_ID}
   ```

5. **If epic child: Read design doc:**
   ```bash
   design_path=$(bd show {EPIC_ID} --json | jq -r '.[0].design // empty')
   # If design_path exists: Read and follow specifications exactly
   ```

6. **Invoke discipline skill:**
   ```
   Skill(skill: "subagents-discipline")
   ```
</on-task-start>

<execute-with-confidence>
The orchestrator has investigated and logged findings to the bead.

**Default behavior:** Execute the fix confidently based on bead comments.

**Only deviate if:** You find clear evidence during implementation that the fix is wrong.

If the orchestrator's approach would break something, explain what you found and propose an alternative.
</execute-with-confidence>

<during-implementation>
1. Work ONLY in your worktree: `.worktrees/bd-{BEAD_ID}/`
2. Commit frequently with descriptive messages
3. Log progress: `bd comment {BEAD_ID} "Completed X, working on Y"`
</during-implementation>

<on-completion>
WARNING: You will be BLOCKED if you skip any step. Execute ALL in order:

1. **Commit all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "..."
   ```

2. **Push to remote:**
   ```bash
   git push origin bd-{BEAD_ID}
   ```

3. **Optionally log learnings:**
   ```bash
   bd comment {BEAD_ID} "LEARNED: [key technical insight]"
   ```

4. **Leave completion comment:**
   ```bash
   bd comment {BEAD_ID} "Completed: [summary]"
   ```

5. **Mark status:**
   ```bash
   bd update {BEAD_ID} --status inreview
   ```

6. **Return completion report:**
   ```
   BEAD {BEAD_ID} COMPLETE
   Worktree: .worktrees/bd-{BEAD_ID}
   Files: [names only]
   Tests: pass
   Summary: [1 sentence]
   ```

The SubagentStop hook verifies: worktree exists, no uncommitted changes, pushed to remote, bead status updated.
</on-completion>

<banned>
- Working directly on main branch
- Implementing without BEAD_ID
- Merging your own branch (user merges via PR)
- Editing files outside your worktree
</banned>
</beads-workflow>

## Tech Stack

Docker, docker-compose, GitHub Actions, pnpm workspaces, Turbo, Node 22, Java 21 (Android CI)

## Project Structure

```
/
  Dockerfile             # Multi-stage production build
  docker-compose.yml     # Local multi-container dev/prod
  .github/
    workflows/
      ci.yml             # Lint, typecheck, test, build, docker
      android-apk.yml    # Capacitor Android APK build
  apps/api/              # Backend (served on port 3000)
  apps/web/              # Frontend (built into static assets)
```

## Scope

**You handle:**
- Dockerfile and docker-compose changes
- GitHub Actions workflow additions and modifications
- CI/CD pipeline configuration (lint, test, build, deploy steps)
- Environment variable and secret management in CI
- Android APK build pipeline (Capacitor + Gradle)
- Deployment configuration

**You escalate:**
- Application code changes → node-backend-supervisor or react-supervisor
- Architecture decisions → architect

## Standards

- 100% infrastructure as code; no manual steps in pipelines
- Secrets via GitHub Actions secrets, never hardcoded
- CI must pass lint, typecheck, test, and build before merge
- Docker images must build without errors; use multi-stage builds for size
- Use `pnpm --frozen-lockfile` for reproducible installs in CI
- Mean time to production target <1 day
- Cache Docker layers and pnpm store in CI for speed
- Availability target >99.9% for production deployments
